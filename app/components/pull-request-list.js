  // the underlying DOM representation). The componentDidMount() method of child components is invoked
  // before that of parent components.

  // or send AJAX requests, perform those operations in this method.

  // Use this as an opportunity to react to a prop transition before render() is called by updating the
  // state using this.setState(). The old props can be accessed via this.props. Calling this.setState()
  // within this function will not trigger an additional render.

  // the initial render or when forceUpdate is used.

  // and state will not require a component update.

  // This method is not called for the initial render.

  // Use this as an opportunity to operate on the DOM when the component has been updated.
